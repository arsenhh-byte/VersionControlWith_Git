#### Git Exercises

I cloned a repository and pushed it to my GitLab. I implemented a `.gitignore` for `.idea`, `.DS_Store`, `out`, and `build` folders. I created a feature branch to upgrade `logstash-logback-encoder` to 7.3 and added an image to `index.html`, then committed and pushed the changes. I created a bugfix branch to fix a spelling error in `Application.java`, then committed and pushed the fix. I merged the feature branch into master via a merge request. I resolved a merge conflict by updating the logger library to 7.2 and merging master into the bugfix branch. I reverted a commit that updated the image URL in `index.html`. I reset a local commit that updated Brunoâ€™s role. I merged the bugfix branch into master directly using the Git CLI. Finally, I deleted the feature and bugfix branches both locally and remotely.
